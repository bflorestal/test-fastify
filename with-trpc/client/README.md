# (With tRPC) Client

This is my first time trying to use tRPC with a React client.

## Setup

You should set the API's URL in the `.env` file. You can use the `.env.example` file as a template.
Then, use your favorite package manager to install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install

# or
yarn install

# or
pnpm install
```

## Run

```bash
npm run dev

# or
yarn dev

# or
pnpm dev
```
