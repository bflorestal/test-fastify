# With tRPC

Since I wanted to try using [tRPC](https://trpc.io) for the first time, I made a small "project" with a Fastify server and a React client.

## Setup

You can check the `client` and the `server` folders for more information about how to setup the project.

There is a Dockerfile in the `server` folder, so you can use it to run the server in a container. But make sure to follow the instructions in the `server` folder to set the environment variables!

## Run the server with Docker

```bash
docker compose up -d
```
