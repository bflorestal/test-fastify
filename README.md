# Testing Fastify

Since it's my first time using [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io), I wanted to test it out and see how it works.
I also wanted to see how it compares to [Express](https://expressjs.com), which I've used before.

## Code

There are two folders in this repo:

- `with-trpc` - This is the version with [tRPC](https://trpc.io), which I was using for the first time as well.
- `without-trpc` - This is the version without [tRPC](https://trpc.io), which I made using a tutorial.
