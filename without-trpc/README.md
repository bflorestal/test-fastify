# Without tRPC

This is a Fastify server I made without [tRPC](https://trpc.io), which I made using [TomDoesTech's tutorial](https://youtu.be/LMoMHP44-xM).

Therefore, I used the same code as in the tutorial, but I made some changes to it. I used:

- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) as the package manager
- [tsx](https://github.com/esbuild-kit/tsx) to run the server
- [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) to hash the passwords
- [Railway](https://railway.app) to get a PostgreSQL database
